Vegan foods that I eat on a normal basis:

* Rice with a lot of different kinds of lentils, with pickled veggies such as pickles, white and red kimchi. I like artichoke hearts, too.
* Vegan yogurt with: nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts), granola, maple syrup, and cinnamon.
* Protein drink: Huel, Oatly, berry juices or frozen blueberries, organic banana.

I thought I should document what I eat so if I run out of ideas of what to eat, I can come back to this. I'll update this list with the exact name of brands.
