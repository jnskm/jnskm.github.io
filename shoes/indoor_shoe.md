[Home](/index.md) / [Shoes](index.md) / Indoor Shoe

Because of the chemotherapy that I received, my toetips (?) and fingertips are sensitive to cold. Because the floors in my current living situation are wood-like, they are cold, during the summer and especially during the winter. So I need indoor shoes.

For winter, I have my UGGs, with sheepskin. For summer, I brought in some Croc slippers, but I can't wear socks with them. So I need something indoor shoes that are:

* Breathable
* Easy to slip in and out of
* Uses as much organic natural materials as much possible
* Made by a reputable company
* Made in a reputable country
* Easy to clean
* Easy to repair
* Durable
* Classic design, nothing fashionable that lasts only a season

# Allbirds

The Men's Tree Loungers for $100 in Kaikoura White with White Sole in size 9 (Allbirds only has whole sizes and suggests sizing down, and I'm 9.5) seems to fit the bill.

* Eucalyptus tree fiber: thermoregulating, lightweight, breathable
* FSC-certified TENCEL Lyocell (eucalyptus tree fiber) upper
* SweetFoam midsole made with sugarcane-based green EVA
* Castor bean oil-based insole foam
* Classic style
* Made in Vietnam

Here's how to clean these:

> Pull out the insoles. Slip your shoes into a delicates bag and toss them in the washing machine -- gentle cycle with cold water with your favorite mild detergent. When they're done, shake off any excess water and let them air dry.

> Handy tips: Don't put them in the dryer. And don't worry, they'll go back to their original shape in no time. You can hand wash your insoles on their own.

Hmm. Air dry. Wonder how long that's going to take. And handwash the insoles. Air dry the insoles too? That's not the easiest to clean, but it is doable.
