# The God Who Waits With You

## Verse:
“Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him.” — Psalm 37:7

## Context:
Psalm 37 was written by King David later in life, after years of battles and betrayals that had taught him to trust God’s perfect timing, even when it felt slow to him. He had seen both the wicked prosper and the faithful suffer, yet he learned that God’s justice and mercy unfold in their own time. When David tells us to “be still,” he is not calling for passivity but for confidence: the calm that comes when we stop trying to hurry what only God can finish.

## Reflection:
At the hospital, the waiting-room clock always seems slower than any other clock in the world. The seconds drag. We pace, check our phones, stare at the floor. We know that behind those closed doors someone is working, yet we cannot see it. Waiting on God often feels the same. We pray, we ache, we wonder if He has forgotten us. But Scripture reminds us that God is never absent while we wait. He is working quietly behind the scenes of our lives. Stillness is not giving up. It is giving over. When we stop striving to make things happen, we create space for His hand to move. And in that surrender, we often find Him closer than before.

## Wisdom:
When nothing seems to move, pray this simple prayer: “Lord, help me to rest while You work.” Let stillness become your act of faith. Today, resist the urge to rush an answer or force an outcome. Choose patience as worship.

## Prayer:
Lord, teach me to wait without fear. Remind me that Your silence is not absence and that every delay carries Your purpose. In my stillness, let me find that You have been with me all along.
