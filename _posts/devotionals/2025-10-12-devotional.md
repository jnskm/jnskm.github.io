# When You Can’t See the Way

## Verse:
“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.” — Psalm 119:105

## Context:
Psalm 119 is the longest psalm — a patient, heartfelt song written by someone who found life and stability in God’s Word. Its anonymous writer speaks much like King David, surrounded by trouble, betrayal, and uncertainty. In ancient Israel, travelers carried small oil lamps that illuminated only a few steps ahead. The psalmist takes that image and turns it into faith: God may not reveal the whole road, but His Word will always give enough light for the next step.

## Reflection:
Imagine you’re driving along the coast. The morning is thick with fog, and you can barely see the yellow lines ahead. It feels as though the world has vanished into the clouds. You slow to a crawl, trusting only the faint glow of your headlights. Life with God often feels the same. We long for a clear map to show every turn, but He offers a lamp that shines only far enough for the next few steps. The psalmist understood this kind of faith — not the faith that demands full sight, but the faith that trusts the One who leads. When we learn to walk by that small light, we discover that His presence, not the path, is our security.

## Wisdom:
When you can’t see far ahead, take one faithful step instead of waiting for certainty. Open Scripture before you open your schedule. Ask, “What small act of obedience can I do today?” — then do that, trusting that tomorrow’s light will come when it’s needed.

## Prayer:
Lord Jesus, when the way before me is hidden, remind me that Your light is enough for today. Keep me walking near Your voice, one small step at a time.
