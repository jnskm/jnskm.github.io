## Twelve Lessons From Good Dogs in a Divided World

In a world where everyone’s picking sides, what does it mean to simply stay faithful?

*One Voice. One Leash. One Lord.* is not a political commentary or a call to join a cause. It’s something more humble — and far more important. Through twelve short lessons, drawn from the loyal wisdom of good dogs and the steady truth of God’s Word, this book invites readers to walk with grace, clarity, and conviction in a world that often feels like it is filled with noise and division.

These stories are simple. The lessons are gentle. But the impact is lasting.

From learning when to speak and when to stay quiet, to guarding what matters and refusing to roll in the mud, each chapter offers a fresh way to think about faithfulness — especially when the world is confusing.

Perfect for readers young and old, One Voice. One Leash. One Lord. is a warm and honest reminder that you don’t have to chase every argument or follow every voice. You just need to walk with the One who never changes.
