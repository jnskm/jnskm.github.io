## Twelve Lessons We Learned From Dogs About Grace In Hard Places

Some books teach. This one sits beside you.

With Me Always shares stories about dogs, their loyalty, their presence, their quiet wisdom and how those simple lessons point to the love of a faithful God. For anyone facing sickness, poverty, fear, or loneliness, this is a companion for the hard days, and a reminder that you are seen, loved, and still being led home.
