# Nylon: Diamine

Nylon is made through a process called polymerization, which involves the linking together of many small molecules called monomers to form long chains of polymer. The monomers used to make nylon are called diamines and dicarboxylic acids.

A diamine is a type of organic compound that contains two amino groups (-NH2) bonded to a single carbon atom. Diamines are used as monomers in the production of nylon and other polyamides. They can be synthesized from a variety of starting materials, including alkyl halides, alkyl sulfates, and aryl halides.

What is an alkyl halide?

An alkyl halide is an organic compound that contains a halogen atom bonded to an alkyl group (a chain of carbon atoms bonded to one another). Alkyl halides are classified based on the size of the alkyl group and the type of halogen atom present. Some common alkyl halides include methane chloride (chloromethane), ethyl chloride (chloroethane), and t-butyl chloride (chlorotert-butane).

Alkyl halides are used in a wide range of chemical reactions including the production of plastics, dyes, and pharmaceuticals. They are also used as solvents and as intermediates in the synthesis of other chemicals. Alkyl halides are generally highly reactive and can be dangerous to handle. They are toxic and can be harmful if inhaled or ingested.

Is alkyl halide harmful to humans?

Alkyl halides are a class of chemical compounds that can be harmful to humans if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. They may cause a variety of health effects, including respiratory irritation, dizziness, headache, and nausea. High levels of exposure can lead to more serious effects, such as unconsciousness and death.
