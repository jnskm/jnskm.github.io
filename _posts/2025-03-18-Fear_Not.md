## Introduction  
Brothers and sisters in Christ, today I want to remind you of a truth so powerful, so unshakable, that it has carried countless believers through storms, battles, and uncertainties:  

God is with you.  

## God’s Promise in Isaiah 41:10  
Isaiah 41:10 says:  

> Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.  

This is not just a comforting thought; it is a divine promise, spoken by the One who never lies, never fails, and never abandons His children.  

## Fear vs. Faith  
Like the lyrics of *Fear Not* say:  

> In the shadows of my doubt, when my fears are screaming loud, You whisper peace into my heart.  

How often do we find ourselves in the grip of fear? When trials come, when questions arise, when the mountains seem too high to climb—we may feel weak, but our God is strong.  

He does not ask us to fight our battles alone. He says:  

> I will strengthen and help you.  

His strength is made perfect in our weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9).  

## The Enemy’s Strategy vs. God’s Assurance  
The enemy wants to use fear to cripple us, to keep us from stepping into the fullness of God’s plan. But the Lord speaks over us, just as He did to Joshua:  

> Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go. (Joshua 1:9)  

As the song says:  

> Mountains rise before my eyes, questions echo through my mind, but you've been faithful through it all.  

Even when we don’t understand, we can trust Him. The same God who has carried us this far will not abandon us now.  

## The Power of Trusting in God’s Promise  
The cross is proof of His love, and the empty tomb is proof of His victory.  

So let’s choose to stand on His promises today. Let’s declare:  

> You've never failed me, you've never left me. Your love surrounds me, your grace astounds me. I'll trust your promise.  

No matter what you face -- fear, doubt, trials -- remember:  

You are not alone. He is still on the throne, and His love remains the same.  

Amen.
