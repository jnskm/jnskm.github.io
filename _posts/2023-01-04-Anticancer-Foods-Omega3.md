Anticancer Foods: Omega-3

Note: I am not a credentialed medical professional. The following text should not be taken as prescriptive advice. The following are my *opinions* based on personal experience, common sense, research online, and books on cancer and nutrition that I have read.

Omega-3 & Cancer

One way that omega-3 fatty acids prevent colon cancer is by reducing inflammation in the body. Inflammation in the colon has been linked to an increased risk of colon cancer, so reducing inflammation lowers this risk.

Inflammation is a normal immune response to injury or infection, but chronic inflammation contributes to the development of a number of health conditions, including cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation in the body by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory substances, such as cytokines and prostaglandins.

Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation by increasing the production of anti-inflammatory substances, such as prostacyclin and resolvins. These substances reduce inflammation and promote healing in the body.

Prostacyclin is a substance that is produced by the body in response to inflammation. It is a type of prostaglandin, which is a group of substances that are involved in a variety of physiological processes, including inflammation, blood pressure regulation, and smooth muscle contraction.

Prostacyclin has anti-inflammatory properties and reduces inflammation in the body. It does this by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory substances, such as cytokines and leukotrienes, and by stimulating the production of other anti-inflammatory substances, such as prostaglandin E2.

Prostacyclin also reduces inflammation by increasing the production of nitric oxide, a molecule relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow. reducing inflammation in the body and promoting healing.

Resolvins are a type of substance that is produced by the body response to inflammation. They are part of a group of substances called specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which resolve inflammation and promote healing in the body.

Resolvins prevent inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory substances, such as cytokines and leukotrienes, and by stimulating the production of other anti-inflammatory substances, such as prostaglandin E2.

Resolvins also reduce inflammation by increasing the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow, which reduce inflammation in the body and promote healing.

Omega-3 fatty acids also prevent colon cancer by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells and promoting cell death.

Omega-3 Foods

Omega-3 is found in a variety of foods, including fatty fish, nuts, and seeds. Plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids include:

1. Flaxseeds: Flaxseeds are a good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is a type of omega-3 fatty acid. They can be ground and added to smoothies, oatmeal, or baked goods. The amount of ALA in flaxseeds varies depending on the variety and the growing conditions, but on average, flaxseeds contain around 40% ALA by weight. One tablespoon of ground flaxseeds contains around 2 grams of ALA. However, it is important to note that the body only converts a small portion of ALA into the more active forms of omega-3s, EPA and DHA. It is generally recommended to consume at least 1-2 tablespoons of ground flaxseeds per day to get the potential benefits of ALA.

2. Chia seeds: Chia seeds are also a good source of ALA. The amount of ALA in chia seeds varies depending on the variety and the growing conditions, but on average, chia seeds contain around 20% ALA by weight. One ounce or 28 grams of chia seeds contains around 4.4 grams of ALA. It is generally recommended to consume at least 1-2 tablespoons of chia seeds per day to get the potential benefits of ALA.

3. Hemp seeds: Hemp seeds are a good source of ALA and also contain other nutrients, such as protein and fiber. The amount of ALA in hemp seeds varies depending on the variety and the growing conditions, but on average, hemp seeds contain around 20% ALA by weight. One ounce or 28 grams of hemp seeds contains around 3.3 grams of ALA. It is generally recommended to consume at least 1-2 tablespoons of hemp seeds per day to get the potential health benefits of ALA.

4. Walnuts: Walnuts are a good source of ALA. The amount of ALA in walnuts varies depending on the variety and the growing conditions, but on average, walnuts contain around 2-5% ALA by weight. One ounce or 28 grams of walnuts contains around 2.5 grams of ALA. It is generally recommended to consume at least 1-2 ounces of walnuts per day to get the potential benefits of ALA.

5. Brussels sprouts: Brussels sprouts are a good source of ALA and also contain other nutrients, such as fiber and vitamin C. The amount of ALA in Brussels sprouts varies depending on the variety and the growing conditions, but on average, Brussels sprouts contain around 0.1-0.2% ALA by weight. One cup or 156 grams of cooked Brussels sprouts contains around 0.2 grams of ALA. While Brussels sprouts are a good source of ALA, they are not a particularly rich source compared to other plant-based sources of omega-3s, such as flaxseeds, chia seeds, or hemp seeds.

It is important to note that plant-based sources of omega-3 fatty acids may not provide as much omega-3s as fatty fish, and they may not have the same health benefits as EPA and DHA, which are types of omega-3s found in fatty fish. However, plant-based sources of omega-3s can still be a good addition to a healthy diet.

EPA & DHA

The three main types of omega-3s are alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

ALA is a plant-based form of omega-3 that is found in a variety of foods, including flaxseeds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds. EPA and DHA are more active forms of omega-3s that are found primarily in fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines.

EPA and DHA are considered to be the more active forms of omega-3s because they are more readily absorbed and utilized by the body than ALA. EPA and DHA are also more effective at reducing inflammation and may have a greater impact on health outcomes than ALA.

For example, EPA and DHA have been shown to have a variety of health benefits, including a potential role in reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. EPA and DHA may also help to improve cognitive function and brain health, and may have a positive effect on mental health.

It is important to note that the body only converts a small portion of ALA into EPA and DHA. The conversion rate may vary depending on individual factors, such as age, sex, and overall diet. Therefore, it is generally recommended to consume EPA and DHA directly, rather than relying on the body to convert ALA into these more active forms of omega-3s.

Salmon, mackerel, and sardines are considered to be the best sources of EPA and DHA because they contain high levels of these fatty acids and are readily absorbed by the body. Other good sources of EPA and DHA include:

1. Seafood: Other types of seafood, such as shellfish, squid, and krill, also contain small amounts of EPA and DHA. Oysters are a good source of EPA and DHA and also contain other nutrients, such as zinc, iron, and vitamin B12. Anchovies are a good source of EPA and DHA and are also low in calories and fat. Shrimp are a good source of EPA and DHA and are also low in calories and fat. Crab is a good source of EPA and DHA and is also rich in other nutrients, such as protein, selenium, and zinc.

2. Fish oil supplements: Fish oil supplements are a convenient way to increase your intake of EPA and DHA. These supplements are made from the oil of fatty fish and are available in capsule or liquid form.

3. Algae oil supplements: Algae oil supplements are another option for vegetarians or vegans who want to increase their intake of EPA and DHA. These supplements are made from algae, which is the primary source of EPA and DHA for fish.

4. Seaweed: The amount of DHA and EPA in seaweed can vary significantly depending on the specific type and where it was grown. For example, one study found that nori, a type of seaweed commonly used in sushi, contained about 50-200 mg of EPA and DHA per 100 grams. Another study found that kelp, another type of seaweed, contained about 70-290 mg of EPA and DHA per 100 grams. It's worth noting that these values can vary widely and that the actual amount of DHA and EPA in a serving of seaweed may be much lower.
