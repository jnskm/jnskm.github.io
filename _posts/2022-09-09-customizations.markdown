Lots of little tweaks to make things look like the way I want them to. My thing is simple: the simpler the better. The subtler it is the better.

White backgrounds into black backgrounds. We get enough blue light from our screens. Black helps reduce blue light exposure. For OLED screens, a largely black background saves energy.

Single font size. A word or string of words on top of the date usually means it's the title. Words and paragraphs below is the body of the post. No need for different size fonts or font faces to distingush them. I kept the date color differentiation.

YYYYMMDD date format. I don't know why we have so many different ways of indicating what day it is. Today is September 9, 2022. This format is the weirdest; there is no logic. But many US things don't make sense: oz, lbs, gallon, inch, feet, yard, mile, etc.
