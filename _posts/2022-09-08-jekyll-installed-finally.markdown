Finally. After so many attempts. The critical flaw in my approach was to jump right in. That was a big no no. What I should have done from the very beginning was to get every single bit of prerequisites installed, updated, and running without a hitch. What is a hitch? If I had to install something using the sudo command.

Next was a version control manager for Ruby. I had tried one, but kept on hanging where it couldn't download a txt file. Ridiculous. Thankfully there was a newer, simpler, faster Ruby version control manager. FRUM I think it was. That worked.

Then Jekyll itself had some things that hung. Again, from the top, step by step, with every letter in the command properly spelled and properly placed. That did the trick. No shortcuts. No jumping the line. Step by step. Character by character. Word by word. Command by command. Computers are not lenient; computers will puke your commands out back at you if you are not 100% correct.

But yes, finally: Jekyll is running on my local machine. Next step: push it to GitHub Pages on [jnskm.github.io][jnskm.github.io]. Fingers crossed.
