I look for clothing that meets these requirements:

= Undyed
= Organic

Although color is nice, most color pigments used to dye clothing are toxic. They are toxic to the workers, toxic to us the customers, and toxic to the environment. Synthetic and toxic pigments are then usually drained into a nearby river, killing the river and all the organisms that live in it and all the organism that depend on it. I look for undyed clothing. That does not mean white; it means the natural color of cotton, linen, and wool.

Organic textiles is also a must. Non-organic cotton comes from cotton farms that spray pesticides, herbicides, and other toxic chemicals. They are toxic to the soil, air, water, and cotton. That toxic cotton is what we wear.

Although this is not a requirement, there are countries where undyed organic textiles come from that are less than trustworthy. Organic can mean one thing to one country and another to another country. I look for undyed organic textiles that have been grown in countries that are known to have strict laws to protect the environment and have strict and comprehensive enforcement of those laws.

I recommend that we all search for and financial support organic textile growers and everyone in the supply chain by buying undyed organic clothing from reputable brands and reputable countries.
