TASTE

Food had to taste good. Texture. Smell. Looks. I chose what I wanted to eat based on these things. I also loved eating meat: t-bone steaks, filet mignon, porterhouse, ribeye. Other meats too: pork chops, bacon, fried chicken, grilled chicken, you name it. Of course I also wanted to eat some foods that were healthy, like salads, fruits, and vegetables, but my main dish was something with meat in it. Sometimes I ate so I could lose weight, or gain muscle. But I don't think at any point in my life I chose food purely for its nutritional value. And that was a big mistake.

MEDICINE

I won't get into the details here, but I got a huge wakeup call from God in October 2021. And it wasn't pretty. I had to turn my life around and part of that was thinking about food differently. I now think of food as medicine.

I made a 180 when it comes to food: I no longer cared much about how food tastes or how it smells or how it looks, I only care about whether or not the foods I put in my mouth are healthy for me. Does it have the nutrition that I need to recover my health and to maintain my health? That's the question I ask before eating anything. And if the answer is no, then it doesn't go into my mouth. Food is medicine.

Does medicine taste good? Most times no. Sometimes yes. But taste is besides the point. You take medicine because you're sick and you want to, need to, get better. Food is that medicine.

ORGANIC + VEGAN

But I've got to be really picky. Just because some foods have the nutrition I need doesn't mean that food is good for me. Non-organic foods might be nutritious, but they also have stuff that's eventually going to kill me: stuff like pesticides, herbicides, and other "-cides" that were developed to kill living organisim. These carcinogens get aborbed into the plants and into the fruits, vegetables, and nuts. And then into you when you eat them. Eat enough of them for a long time and you're bound to get sick because synthetic pesticides and herbicides cannot be processed by the body and not all of them can be excreted; they will accumulate and when they do will likely cause some type of cancer. That's why I do my very best to eat organic foods.

Another thing I don't eat anymore: meat. Can you imagine all the bad stuff you're putting into your mouth everytime you eat meat? Think of what *they* eat, because that's what you'll end up eating and a whole bunch of other stuff that's not good for you. Pharmaceautical companies make most of their money selling drugs to animal agriculture companies: folks who grow cows, pigs, etc. inject a whole bunch of stuff that's not good for them. And they're not good for us either. So that meat-loving me is gone; I'm vegan now.

The only stuff I'll happily eat are stuff that's organic vegan. Gluten-free is even better.

FOOD = MEDICINE

Food as medicine. As long as I eat with that in mind, I'm giving my body the best chance it has of regaining health and maintaining health.
