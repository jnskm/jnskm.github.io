## More Formaldehyde In Your Life

[This New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/climate/epa-lynn-dekleva-formaldehyde.html) discusses Lynn Dekleva, who has recently taken a senior role at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overseeing the approval of new chemicals. Previously, Dekleva was a lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, where she led efforts to block regulations on formaldehyde, a chemical known to cause cancer and respiratory issues. Reduce stuff that causes cancer or make more money? She is squarely on the "make more money" side.

The EPA had been working to regulate formaldehyde since 2021, but faced strong opposition from the chemical industry, spearheaded by Dekleva. Her appointment, alongside another former industry lobbyist, Nancy Beck, raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the influence of the chemical industry on EPA policies under the current administration. Dekleva and Beck will lead to weaker regulations on harmful chemicals. That's a nice way of saying it: the chemical industry is celebrating. Weak regulation of cancer-causing chemicals like formaldehyde means more sales and more profits. It also means more cancer and death.

## How Formaldehyde Causes Cancer And Kills You

Formaldehyde causes cancer through a combination of direct damage to your cells and the chaos it unleashes in your body over time. It’s a tricky chemical: small, reactive, and good at sneaking into places it shouldn’t. Here’s how it destroys your body.

**Step 1: It Gets In and Stays In**

When you breathe in formaldehyde (say, from off-gassing furniture or cigarette smoke), it hits your nasal passages, throat, and lungs first. It’s water-soluble, so it sticks to moist tissues like a clingy guest. If it’s on your skin (from cosmetics or fabrics), it can absorb there too. Once inside, it doesn’t just sit around; it’s a reactive little molecule, eager to bond with stuff in your cells.

**Step 2: DNA Damage -- Breaking the Blueprint**

Formaldehyde is an electrophile, meaning it loves grabbing onto electron-rich molecules like DNA and proteins. It reacts with the building blocks of DNA (especially adenine and guanine) and forms what’s called DNA adducts -- weird, unwanted attachments. These adducts mess up the DNA’s structure, like using your unreadable handwriting to scribble over a perfect recipe honed over well since God created human beings. When your cells try to copy that DNA to make new cells, they can misread it, leading to mutations: permanent typos in the genetic code. If those mutations hit critical genes (like ones controlling cell growth), you’ve got a potential cancer starter.

It also cross-links DNA strands or DNA to proteins, messing up the works even more. This makes it harder for cells to repair damage or divide properly, piling on the risk of errors.

**Step 3: Chronic Irritation and Inflammation**

Formaldehyde isn’t a one-and-done deal; it’s a slow burn. Repeated exposure (think years of breathing it in from your MDF desk) irritates tissues, especially in the nose and throat. This constant irritation triggers inflammation -- a state where your immune system’s on high alert, pumping out chemicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are like tiny wrecking balls, causing more DNA damage. Over time, this cycle of irritation and inflammation wears down your body’s defenses, giving damaged cells a chance to go rogue.

**Step 4: Cell Growth Goes Haywire**

Those mutations and inflammation can flip switches in your cells. Normally, genes like tumor suppressors (e.g., p53) keep cell growth in check, while oncogenes push it forward. Formaldehyde’s damage can turn off the brakes (mutating tumor suppressors) or slam the gas (activating oncogenes). The result? Cells start dividing uncontrollably, piling up into abnormal clumps—tumors. If they’re in the right (or wrong) spot and keep mutating, they can turn malignant: cancer.

### Where It Hits Hardest

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies formaldehyde as a Group 1 carcinogen: definitely cancer-causing in humans. The strongest evidence ties it to nasopharyngeal cancer (nose and throat) and sinonasal cancer (sinuses), since that’s where inhaled formaldehyde lingers. There’s also a link to leukemia, though it’s trickier to pin down. Scientists think formaldehyde or its byproducts (like formaldehyde-damaged proteins) might travel through the blood to bone marrow, screwing up blood cell production and leading to cancerous changes there.

### Dose and Time Matter

It’s not instant; cancer from formaldehyde takes chronic exposure, often at higher levels than most folks get daily (think factory workers, not just someone with a new dresser). Studies of industrial workers exposed to 1-2 parts per million (ppm) over years show the risk spiking. For context, household levels are usually below 0.1 ppm, but they add up, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The longer and more intense the exposure, the higher the odds. Keep this in mind: most homes are poorly ventilated. Most homes have a lot -- a lot more than you think -- of stuff that off-gasses formaldehyde. We'll get to thet in just a bit.

### Why It’s Sneaky

Your body can detox small amounts via enzymes (like aldehyde dehydrogenase), turning formaldehyde into harmless formic acid. But overwhelm that system -- say, with daily doses from multiple sources -- and the damage accumulates. That's almost all of us living in an industrialized environment. It’s a numbers game: more hits to DNA, more chances for a cancer-causing mutation to stick.

In short, formaldehyde causes cancer by smashing into your DNA, sparking inflammation, and letting mutated cells run wild. It’s a slow, relentless process, not a lightning strike, perfectly suited to its role as an everyday lurker in our stuff.

## Formaldehyde Is Everywhere

Formaldehyde is a sneaky little chemical; it’s everywhere in everyday life, often in ways you wouldn’t suspect. It’s a colorless, pungent gas used as a preservative, disinfectant, or adhesive, and it’s either added directly to products, released over time from other chemicals, or used in the manufacturing process of materials we touch every single day. Here’s a breakdown of the things normal folks use regularly that have formaldehyde in them, on them, or involved in their creation, along with the materials tied to it. Brew a cup of coffee, and sit in your comfy chair; it’s a long list.

## Why It’s Everywhere

Formaldehyde is cheap, effective, and versatile. It binds things together (furniture, fabrics), kills bacteria (cleaners, cosmetics), and preserves stuff (nail polish, bodies in morgues). The catch? It off-gasses -- releases vapor over time -- especially in new products or warm, humid conditions. Most exposure comes from breathing it in, though skin contact matters, too.

Not every item has high levels; some just have traces from manufacturing. Modern regulations (like in California) push for low-emission versions, but it’s still in tons of stuff. You’re surrounded by it: your couch, your shirt, your shampoo, even your car. It’s not always a panic-level threat—small amounts are normal—but it adds up, especially indoors where ventilation’s poor.

Want to dodge it? Go for solid wood, organic fabrics, and products labeled “formaldehyde-free” or “low-VOC.” Air out new purchases, and open your windows if the outside air is cleaner than the air inside your home. Your daily life’s full of it, but you’ve got some control, if you’re *really* picky.

Going back to Dekleve and Beck at the EPA: there will be less regulation for chemicals like formaldehyde. We have no choice but to be super picky about what we buy. Going forward stuff available for purchase will have a bunch more chemicals that will cause cancer and kill us.
