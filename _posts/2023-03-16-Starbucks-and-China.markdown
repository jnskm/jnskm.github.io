[Starbucks's China expansion stirs up conservative shareholder trouble for Howard Schultz][1] by Clint Rainey, writing for Fast Company:

> In pursuit of growth, the chain has, among other things, helped the government to develop rural infrastructure in China’s Yunnan coffee province, and established a foundation that has organized so-called red-tourism trips and commended “the high fighting spirit and steel will” of the People’s Liberation Army.

Every time we buy something that is "Made in China" or "Assembled in China" will indirectly help financially support the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

But Starbucks seems to be accelerating its full support of the CCP and its military arm, the People's Liberation Army.

I haven't spent money at a Starbucks for some time, for other reasons such as: overpriced coffee, underwhelming coffee, inconsistent coffee, as well as earth-destroying single-use coffee cups, lids, and those green plastic lid stoppers. Now, I'm adding: supporter of the CCP.

I don't think this is a left or right, liberal or conservative issue: we are talking about whether we should continue buying from a company that seems to be supporting a government that is fighting against our ideals of life, freedom, and liberty.
