The most affordable solution is to fix the front suspension of the Pathfinder. Thatâ€™s it. And it should last at least several thousand miles or more likely many tens of thousands of miles.

Yes, it's an old car. 18 years old in fact. But it doesn't have a lot of miles. Around 150K I think. The catalytic converter has been replaced. The rear upper and lower control arms have been replaced, and with them the bushings have been replaced that fixed the rear bobbling that is known to happen to these Pathfinders.

The thing to do is to make the most of what we have. And ask the Lord to bless the things we have so we can continue to use them to do the Lord's work while we are here and able.
