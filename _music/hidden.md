## Inspiration

Truly You are a God Who has been hiding Himself,
the God and Savior of Israel. Isaiah 45:15.

## Lyrics
<pre class="lyrics-content">
[intro]
You're still here
even when I can't see

[verse 1]
midnight quiet
I'm calling Your name
feel's like heaven's
staying the same
but I know You move
where eye's can't go
hidden mercy starts to grow

[pre-chorus]
when I don't feel You
still I'll sing
faith's that whisper
in the wind

[chorus]
You're hidden
not gone
working in the dark
still holding on
You're hidden
not gone
love don't need the light
to keep me strong

[verse 2]
clouds can hide
a sun that shines
grace is moving
through the lines
when I wait
You're never late
every silence
holds my faith

[bridge]
I don't need proof
I just believe
Your unseen hand
is holding me

[final chorus]
You're hidden
not gone
working in the dark
still holding on
You're hidden
not gone
love don't need the light
to keep me strong

[outro]
hidden
not gone
still my Savior
still my song
</pre>
