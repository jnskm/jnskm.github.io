## Bible Verse
Romans 8:38-39 (NIV)

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Inspiration

The Lord's mercy and grace has no limit. Our eternal God did not remain distant. He entered into time and became human to save us. But our Lord did not stop there. Through the death and ressurection of Jesus, the Holy Spirit now dwells within our hearts, patiently transforming us into children of God. This is ultimate truth. Infinite love. Our Father freely gives to us.

His love leaves traces everywhere. We feel it in the warmth of the morning sun and see it in the quiet beauty of the sunset. We glimpse it in the countless stars that fill the night sky, in the cool breeze that passes by, and in the rich colors of autumn as the world slows down. Creation does not explain God's love, but it points to it. Again and again.

Mercy without measure. Grace without end. God who loves us and remains with us.

## Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Before the stars
Before the light
You were love
You came down

Heaven’s King
In human skin
You came close
To save us

[Pre-Chorus]
From forever
Into time

[Chorus]
No limit, no end
Your mercy again
You pull me close
You pull me close

끝이 없는 자비
주님의 은혜
저를 부르세요
저를 안으세요

[Verse 2]
You didn’t stay
So far away
You made a home
Inside my heart

No more fear
No more shame
I am Yours
I am changed

[Pre-Chorus]
From forever
Into time

[Chorus]
No limit, no end
Your mercy again
You pull me close
You pull me close

끝이 없는 자비
주님의 은혜
저를 부르세요
저를 안으세요

[Bridge]
Morning sun
On my face
Every sky
Shows Your grace

Stars at night
Speak Your truth
All the world
Sings of You

주님의 사랑이
온 세상에
속삭여요

[Final Chorus]
No limit, no end
Your mercy again
You pull me close
You pull me close

끝이 없는 자비
주님의 은혜
예수님 안에서
저는 살아가요

[Outro]
No limit
No end

끝이 없는 사랑
멈추지 않는 은혜
