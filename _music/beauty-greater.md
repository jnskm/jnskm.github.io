## Bible Verse
Ecclesiastes 3:11

He has made everything beautiful in its time.
He has also set eternity in the human heart;

## Inspiration

There is beauty all around us.
The blue sky.
The vast and powerful, yet calming ocean.
The formation of mountains.
The faces of those we love.

And sometimes, we stop there.

But there is a beauty greater than all of these.
Not a thing.
A Person.
Not something created.
The One through whom all things were made:

Jesus.

## Lyrics
<pre class="lyrics-content">
[Verse 1]<br>
There’s beauty in the ocean
Beauty in the air
숨을 쉬는 이 순간
Beauty everywhere

Mountains in the distance
Trees older than time
말없이 말해 주는
Everything is fine

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
All these things catch my eye
왔다가 사라져
They don’t stay, they pass me by
계속 흘러가

[Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere
Everywhere I go
아름다움 everywhere
Yeah, I know, I know

But there’s beauty greater
더 큰 아름다움
There’s beauty greater
When I turn to You

[Chorus Tag]<br>
더 큰 아름다움
더 큰 아름다움

[Verse 2]<br>
There’s beauty in a moment
Beauty in a face
눈을 돌리면 또 다른
Kind of grace

But the shine is always fading
Every high comes down
영원한 아름다움
That’s what I’ve found

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
All these things catch my eye
왔다가 사라져
They don’t stay, they pass me by
계속 흘러가

[Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere
Everywhere I go
아름다움 everywhere
Yeah, I know, I know

But there’s beauty greater
더 큰 아름다움
There’s beauty greater
You’re the One I know

[Bridge]<br>
You came close
내 곁으로
You took my place
십자가로

Death let go
끝이 아니야
You’re alive
지금 여기야

[Bridge Tag]<br>
죽음을 이기신 분

[Final Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere
Everywhere I go
아름다움 everywhere
Yeah, I know, I know

But there’s beauty greater
더 큰 아름다움
There’s beauty greater
Jesus, You are Love

[Outro]<br>
나는 변해가
주 닮아 가
더 큰 아름다움
Enough for me
