## Bible Verse
Ecclesiastes 3:11

He has made everything beautiful in its time.
He has also set eternity in the human heart;

## Inspiration

There is beauty all around us.
The blue sky.
The vast and powerful, yet calming ocean.
The formation of mountains.
The faces of those we love.

And sometimes, we stop there.

But there is a beauty greater than all of these.
Not a thing.
A Person.
Not something created.
The One through whom all things were made:

Jesus.

## Lyrics
[Verse 1]<br>
There’s beauty in the ocean<br>
Beauty in the air<br>
숨을 쉬는 이 순간<br>
Beauty everywhere<br>

Mountains in the distance<br>
Trees older than time<br>
말없이 말해 주는<br>
Everything is fine<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
All these things catch my eye<br>
왔다가 사라져<br>
They don’t stay, they pass me by<br>
계속 흘러가<br>

[Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere<br>
Everywhere I go<br>
아름다움 everywhere<br>
Yeah, I know, I know<br>

But there’s beauty greater<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>
There’s beauty greater<br>
When I turn to You<br>

[Chorus Tag]<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>

[Verse 2]<br>
There’s beauty in a moment<br>
Beauty in a face<br>
눈을 돌리면 또 다른<br>
Kind of grace<br>

But the shine is always fading<br>
Every high comes down<br>
영원한 아름다움<br>
That’s what I’ve found<br>

[Pre-Chorus]<br>
All these things catch my eye<br>
왔다가 사라져<br>
They don’t stay, they pass me by<br>
계속 흘러가<br>

[Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere<br>
Everywhere I go<br>
아름다움 everywhere<br>
Yeah, I know, I know<br>

But there’s beauty greater<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>
There’s beauty greater<br>
You’re the One I know<br>

[Bridge]<br>
You came close<br>
내 곁으로<br>
You took my place<br>
십자가로<br>

Death let go<br>
끝이 아니야<br>
You’re alive<br>
지금 여기야<br>

[Bridge Tag]<br>
죽음을 이기신 분<br>

[Final Chorus]<br>
There’s beauty everywhere<br>
Everywhere I go<br>
아름다움 everywhere<br>
Yeah, I know, I know<br>

But there’s beauty greater<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>
There’s beauty greater<br>
Jesus, You are Love<br>

[Outro]<br>
나는 변해가<br>
주 닮아 가<br>
더 큰 아름다움<br>
Enough for me<br>
