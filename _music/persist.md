# Inspiration

"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers." Galatians 6:9-10.

I want to persist. Even when I am weary. Especially when I am weary.

The road is narrow. The road is long. Some days I am tired. Some days I want to stop. Some days I wonder if any of it matters.

But Paul reminds me: the weariness is not the end. There is a harvest coming. I may not see it today. I may not see it tomorrow. But it is coming. At the proper time. So I will not give up.

I will keep doing good. I will keep loving my brothers and sisters. I will keep walking.

This is what I will do: walk the narrow road until the end. For the Lord. For the family of believers. For the harvest.

Until the end.

# Lyrics

<pre class="lyrics-content">
[Verse 1]
weary hands and tired eyes
fields of hope beneath these skies
seasons pass, the days grow long
but something deep inside stays strong
I won't give up, I can't let go
there's a harvest time, I know

[Chorus]
I'm still sowing seeds of light
though the darkness blinds my sight
I'm still walking toward that day
when all the pain will fade away
I'm still hoping, I'm still trying
I'm still loving, I'm still fighting

[Verse 2]
the road stretches far ahead
echoes of the words You said
"Do not grow weary doing good"
I would stop if only I could
but love compels me to go on
until the final battle's won

[Chorus]
I'm still sowing seeds of light
though the darkness blinds my sight
I'm still walking toward that day
when all the pain will fade away
I'm still hoping, I'm still trying
I'm still loving, I'm still fighting

[Verse 3]
every kindness, every deed
every hungry soul I feed
is a promise I won't fall
though I stumble, though I crawl
the opportunity remains
to ease another's pain

[Final Chorus]
I'm still sowing seeds of light
though the darkness blinds my sight
I'm still walking toward that day
when all the pain will fade away
I'm still hoping, I'm still trying
I'm still loving, I'm persisting
I'm still loving, I'm persisting
