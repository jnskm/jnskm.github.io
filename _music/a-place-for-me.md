# Inspiration

Jesus said: "Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in Me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with Me that you also may be where I am." John 14:1-3.

I want to be content with where I am today. Not longing for more. Not wishing for a different situation. Just wanting more of the Lord. Wanting to be more like Him.

I want to grow in the fruit of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Galatians 5:22–23. I want to be more focused on loving the Lord and loving my neighbor. And I want to be obedient. Because Jesus said, "Anyone who loves me will obey my teaching. My Father will love them, and we will come to them and make our home with them." John 14:23.

But there are two ways to be content. I want a content heart. Content with my circumstances. Thankful for everything the Lord has given. And I want to be content with Jesus. But to be fully content, my heart needs to keep growing in love for Him. In becoming like Jesus, I don't want to be content. I want to keep becoming more like Him. In every way.

That is the only way to live. To be truly alive. To live as a human being. To live as me. Jesus created me. Jesus died for me. Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to live in my heart. And Jesus is preparing a place for me.
My home is not here. My home is in heaven, with my brothers and sisters, with my Father, my Savior, and my Holy Spirit.

Home in heaven.

# Lyrics

<pre class="lyrics">
[Verse 1]
when the nights are long, and I’m all alone
no door to knock on, no place to call home
but deep inside, I hear Him say,
“I’m not far. I’m on the way.”

[Chorus]
He’s preparing a place for me
a home where I’ll be seen
He said I'll be with Him
He’s preparing a place for me

[Verse 2]
people may leave, and plans fall apart
but I’m not forgotten, I’m close to His heart
He sees the tears, He knows my pain
nut He’s building a place that will always remain

[Chorus]
He’s preparing a place for me
a home where I’ll be seen
He said I'll be with Him
He’s preparing a place for me

[Bridge]
troubled heart, don’t be afraid
He keeps every promise He made
the road feels long, but it won’t be forever
He’s coming back, we’ll be together

[Final Chorus]
He’s preparing a place for me
a home where I’ll be seen
He said I'll be with Him
He’s preparing a place for me
