## Inspiration

But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Matthew 6:33.

There are a lot of things we want in life. Some are wants, but some are needs. We need peace. We need joy. We need love. But it seems when we search for peace, joy, and love... we can't quite get it. Or if we think we did, it's not what we thought it was going to be. God tells us the right way. If we really want true peace, joy, and love, the way to get them is by wanting God. Not more, but most. Wanting God most. If we want God most, we will get peace, joy, and love. And everything else that really matters in life. But how do we get to wanting God most? The only way I know is to start loving Jesus, by responding to His love for us. We know Jesus loves us by what He did on the cross. And when Jesus was resurrected and returned to be with the Father, He sent the Holy Spirit to be with us. Believe that the Holy Spirit lives within us. It is the Holy Spirit who does the actual changing, the transforming, of our hearts. When our hearts start to transform into a heart that is like Jesus, we can start loving God more and more. And at some point we will love God most. And when that happens, we will be blessed with peace. With joy. With love. But the best part is that God Himself will be much more than that.

## Lyrics
<pre class="lyrics-content">
[Verse 1]
We chase after peace, we search for joy.
We reach out for love to fill the void.
But all of these gifts come from Your hand.
We forget the Giver while chasing our plans.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every longing inside us is calling us home.
주님께 돌아가요.
Every blessing we want is found in You alone.
주만 우리 도움이시니.

[Chorus]
So we seek You first, first of all.
Your kingdom come, Your mercy calls.
우린 주만 원해요.
우리 맘을 이끄소서.
Lord, we seek You first, first of all.

[Verse 2]
The world tells our hearts to run and strive.
To work for the things we think give life.
But You lift our eyes to a better way.
To trust in Your promise for every day.

[Pre-Chorus]
Every longing inside us is calling us home.
주님께 돌아가요.
Every blessing we want is found in You alone.
주만 우리 도움이시니.

[Chorus]
So we seek You first, first of all.
Your kingdom come, Your mercy calls.
우린 주만 원해요.
우리 맘을 이끄소서.
Lord, we seek You first, first of all.

[Verse 3]
When shadows grow long and hopes grow thin,
We run back to You again and again.
For You are the strength our hearts depend on.
You stay beside us and lead us home.

[Bridge]
You are the peace we’re longing for.
평안을 주시는 분.
You are the joy our hearts adore.
기쁨의 샘 되시는 주.
You are the love that never fades.
사랑이 변치 않는 주.
You are the One our souls must chase.
우리의 주, 오직 주님.

[Final Chorus]
So we seek You first, first of all.
Your kingdom come, Your mercy calls.
우린 주만 원해요.
우리 맘을 이끄소서.
Lord, we seek You first, first of all.
