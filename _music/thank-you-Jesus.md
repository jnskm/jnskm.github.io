## Bible Verse

Romans 5:8

But God demonstrated His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. 

## Inspiration

Today I found myself thinking about the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and how impossible it is for me to fully understand what He gave up to save us. This side of heaven, there is no way to grasp the full punishment He took upon Himself. It was not only for a moment in history, but for every human being, from Adam to the very last person who will ever be born. I cannot imagine what it meant for His relationship with the Father and the Holy Spirit to be broken in that moment, or how much He truly suffered. And yet, because of Jesus, I am forgiven. Because of Jesus, the Holy Spirit lives in me. I am being changed, slowly and gently, from who I was into a child of God. And because of Him, I know I have a home waiting for me in heaven. One day, I will live as one with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Tonight, all I can say is thank You, Jesus.

## Lyrics
<pre class="lyrics-content">
[Verse 1]
From the cradle to the cross You came,
Heaven’s glory laid aside.
Born to walk this broken world,
Love made flesh, the perfect sacrifice.

No mind can know, no heart can see,
The cost You chose to bear.
The weight of every sin of man,
From Adam’s breath to final prayer.

[Chorus]
Thank You, Jesus, for the cross.
Thank You, Jesus, for Your love.
You bore the pain, You paid the price,
So we could live, so we could rise.

감사해요 예수님
십자가의 사랑
우릴 살리신 은혜로
오늘도 살아가요

[Verse 2]
This side of heaven we will never know
How deep the suffering went.
When fellowship was torn apart,
When all our judgment on You fell.

The Father’s face, the Spirit’s joy,
For a moment veiled from sight.
Yet love endured the darkest hour
To bring us back into the light.

[Chorus]
Thank You, Jesus, for the cross.
Thank You, Jesus, for Your love.
You bore the pain, You paid the price,
So we could live, so we could rise.

감사해요 예수님
어둠 속의 빛
죽음을 이기신 주
우리의 소망

[Bridge]
Now Your Spirit lives in us,
A holy fire, a gentle voice.
We are changed from dust to heirs,
From fear to hope, from slaves to sons.

이제 우리는 하나
성령 안에서
자녀로 부르신 주
주의 은혜로 살아가

[Verse 3]
Because of You we have a home,
A life beyond this tearful land.
Where we will live as one forever
With the Father’s loving hand.

No more death and no more pain,
No more night, no parting breath.
Just endless joy and perfect peace
In resurrection life and rest.

[Final Chorus]
Thank You, Jesus, for the cross.
Thank You, Jesus, for Your love.
You bore the pain, You paid the price,
So we could live, so we could rise.

감사해요 예수님
영원한 생명
아버지와 성령과
함께 살 그날

[Outro]
Thank You, Jesus.
감사해요 예수님.
Forever we will sing Your name.
