After running around a dark, windy, narrow, dirty, rabbit hole with lots of deadends, I've decided to give up (not a phrase I like to use often) trying to figure out Jekyll, especially running it locally on a Windows 11 machine. Lots of errors. Ruby and all sorts of stuff I don't need to know. My goal is to document what I am learning. And the simpler all this tech stuff the better.

I'll do my own content management and do it simply with text files formatted in markdown.

Finally, I've been able to setup GitHub to run my website at:
