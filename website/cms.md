# Text Editor

I've tried Microsoft's OneNote, Apple's Notes, Google's Evernote. There is one common thing that I don't like about almost all note apps: the use of fancy fonts. I prefer a stripped-down non-fancy fixed-width font. The font that I prefer is Courier Prime Code. It is a more modern Courier font that differentiates O (uppercase o) and 0 (zero).

Also, I can nest folder upon folder using hyperlinks; not so with a lot of these note apps. Because these note apps are more or less flat, meaning there is no hierarchy, I find it more difficult to mentally and visually organize. With Microsoft's Visual Studio Code's Explorer, it is easy to see the hierarchical structure of each of my folders and articles.

Instead of a website how about we just start a folder. We use normal Letter-sized paper and write on it. Or use a regular notepad that we can find on Amazon for a good price. Get a bunch of them and just use them for the rest of my life. Fold flat? Might want to scan them later on. Print out photos. And maybe tape them on the notes. Something tangible. More analog and less digital. Type notes out. And then three-hole-punch them and put them in a folder.

Okay, here’s what we can do. Write down notes wherever. Notepad. Smartphone. Pieces of paper. Wherever. And then at the end of the day, type them up. Hole punch. And put in folder. That will help chunk everything that I thought about during the day. And add stuff I didn’t think about. Probably will think new things as I go through all the daily thoughts.

## Syncing Underlines And Notes Between Digital And Analog Books

A transparent stylus-aware (but eminently usable with finger) slate or peace of glass you put over an analog book. When you underline or take notes, it syncs with the electronic version. So you’re always synced whether you’re reading on your e-reader, your smartphone, or a real analog book. It goes the other way too: when you place the glass slate over the real page all the highlights and notes show up too.

When I am away from home I usually read on my phone. When I am home I usually read the real book, with a pencil in hand. But when I do that, there is a lapse.

## One e-Book File with Links

There's a different approach. Have one central e-book file that all the devices access. In my case those devices will be my smartphones, laptop, and reMarkable. When I read my e-books, underline them, and jot down notes, they will all sync with the central file and all the other devices will have those underlines and notes updated. This would be a much simpler and more feasible approach.

Structure my writings this way:

* Goal(s)
* Challenge(s)
* Bottomline

After writing something, add these three subtitles at the beginning of the post. This way I can quickly see what the post is about and specifically what the outcome, the result, the bottomline is.
