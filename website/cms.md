# Text Editor

I've tried Microsoft's OneNote, Apple's Notes, Google's Evernote. There is one common thing that I don't like about almost all note apps: the use of fancy fonts. I prefer a stripped-down non-fancy fixed-width font. The font that I prefer is Courier Prime Code. It is a more modern Courier font that differentiates O (uppercase o) and 0 (zero).

Also, I can nest folder upon folder using hyperlinks; not so with a lot of these note apps. Because these note apps are more or less flat, meaning there is no hierarchy, I find it more difficult to mentally and visually organize. With Microsoft's Visual Studio Code's Explorer, it is easy to see the hierarchical structure of each of my folders and articles.
