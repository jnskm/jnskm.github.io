# Text Editor

I've tried Microsoft's OneNote, Apple's Notes, Google's Evernote. There is one common thing that I don't like about almost all note apps: the use of fancy fonts. I prefer a stripped-down non-fancy fixed-width font. The font that I prefer is Courier Prime Code. It is a more modern Courier font that differentiates O (uppercase o) and 0 (zero).

Also, I can nest folder upon folder using hyperlinks; not so with a lot of these note apps. Because these note apps are more or less flat, meaning there is no hierarchy, I find it more difficult to mentally and visually organize. With Microsoft's Visual Studio Code's Explorer, it is easy to see the hierarchical structure of each of my folders and articles.

Structure my writings this way:

* Goal(s)
* Challenge(s)
* Bottomline

After writing something, add these three subtitles at the beginning of the post. This way I can quickly see what the post is about and specifically what the outcome, the result, the bottomline is.
