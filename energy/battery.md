I really need to get an emergency battery. Solar powered. Maybe even cycle powered. California is going to have a lot less electricity this summer because of hydro power generating considerably less electricity than before because of the drought. What that means is that we will have blackouts more often than before because of less electricity and because we are probably going to experience very high temperatures due to climate change and use way more electricity for air conditioning all at the same time. The only way to get through this is if we have a back up battery that can keep the refrigerator going and provide a way to cook even if it just means running a blender.
