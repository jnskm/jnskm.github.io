When I walk at the nearby park there is some discomfort around my left hip area. Standing for too long exacerbates the pain. So, my idea is to do some yoga. But first, to do that, I need a yoga mat. What are some things that I am looking far in a yoga mat?

* Natural materials like cotton, wool, cork, etc.
* The aforementioned natural materials should be grown in a non-toxic way (organic) and in a sustainable way.
* Should not be made in China or other countries that do not value human dignity, freedom, liberty, democracy. I am seriously considering not purchasing anything from India as the country has been a major economic supporter of Russia by more than doubling its purchase of Russian oil.
