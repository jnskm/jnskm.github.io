Bottomline: Got the NodricTrack S22i for $470.

Yesterday, I went to see a guy selling his NodricTrack S22i for $500 on Craigslist. Says it was in mint condition. I looked it up online and the price is about $1200 brand new and the reviews were pretty good: one of the best ones out there head-to-head in most categories with the Peloton. There were times when I didn't want to go look at it. Then I thought, "What's to lose?" I even thought that this might be some evil scheme to jump me and steal my cash. I wanted to give Aaron an indoor cycling option. I went there and there it was: a mint-condition S22i. Everything worked. I mentioned that he said on his CL post about being open to a best offer, so he said $475. I countered saying that I had exact change for $470. He said okay. It took some time to get the S22i into the Pathfinder, but we were able to. The thing is heavy. I think about 300 pounds. After some thought I decided that it wouldn't be very good for Aaron: I'm going to have to get him a recumbant indoor cycling system so he feels more secure in the seat. After a long day, I was able to bring the S22 into my small room, install it, and get in a 30-minute cycling exercise to close my exercise ring. I was sweaty so I took a shower and slept pretty well.
