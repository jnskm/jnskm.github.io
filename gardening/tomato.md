The planter I got from Kickstarter is called Greenfinity. It has a nifty watering solution where I can water from the ground up. The "watering hole" was dry, so I filled it up today.

From [Peaceful Valley](https://www.groworganic.com):

* Tender Annual, Heirloom: Indeterminate. This is a truly tasty cherry tomato. Large, disease reisstant vines set abundant crops of 1" fruits borne in clusters. A perfect cherry for salads and snacking. This cherry was developed by brilliant horticulturist Alan Chadwick and bears his name.
* Soil and Water: Tomatoes love fertile soil rich in organic matter. Add plenty of compost prior to planting. Soil pH is preferred between 5.5-7.0. Soak the soil 4-6" deep at 7-day intervals.
* Planting and Growing: Sow seeds in flats 6-8 weeks before the last frost and thin to 2" after the first true leaves appear. Before transplanting after the last frost, harden off the plants by placing them outdoors for a few hours to start, increasing the amount of time each day until they are accustomed to a full day of sunlight.
* Harvesting and Storage: Harvest when individual fruits give slightly under finger pressure; the shoulders may not have changed color yet. Cut or twist off while supporting the vine.
