Kuroda Carrots
* Temp: ~73F
* Planted them outside in a large planter.
* Seven (70) locations with about 4-5 seeds in each location.
Mixed:
* Some soil that my sister got for me from Home Depot. Kind of almost mulch-like.
* Added some compost from Lomi, about 80% of the bucket.
* Added a little bit of coffee grounds.
Thoroughly watered. I'd say about half of the watering can. Need to measure more accurately (?)
