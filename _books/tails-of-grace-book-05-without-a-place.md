## Twelve Lessons on Homelessness from Good Dogs and Our Faithful God

Even without a place to call home, we are never without the Shepherd. In this fifth book of the *Tails of Grace* series, twelve heartfelt stories remind us that God's love reaches into every alley, under every bridge, and behind every closed door. Through the eyes of good dogs and the lives of those who have lost their homes, we find glimpses of a God who never forgets us, never forsakes us, and always welcomes us back.

Each lesson blends a tender story with reflections on Scripture, offering comfort, insight, and gentle encouragement for anyone who has felt lost, forgotten, or alone. Whether you've experienced homelessness firsthand or carry a burden for those who have, this book points to the One who calls us by name, who leads us beside still waters, and who prepares a place for us.

This is a book for anyone who wonders if they still belong. The answer, in every story, is yes.
