## Twelve Lessons We Learned From Dogs About Loving God

*Sit. Stay. Preach.* is a gentle, story-driven reflection on life, faith, and what it means to follow Jesus faithfully. Told through the eyes of an ordinary deacon, an ordinary lay person, and ordinary dogs, including one dog named Mola. She didn't care much for things that didn't matter, but she always stayed close. And in that quiet closeness, there was wisdom.

Through muddy paws, tennis balls, porch waits, and tail wags, these stories offer encouragement to the spiritual sphepherds who feel overlooked, tired, or just trying to keep going. We don't have to be important to be faithful. We just have to stay close to the one and true Shepherd.

This book is for those who love Jesus, love dogs, and want to live a life of quiet and steady grace.
