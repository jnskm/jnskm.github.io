## Twelve Lessons from Dogs That Make Us Wiser at Work

Business doesn’t have to be cutthroat to be strong. It doesn’t have to be noisy to be good. And it certainly doesn’t have to be godless to succeed.

In this gentle and encouraging book, the fourth in the *Tails of Grace* series, we look to dogs, and to God, for wisdom about how to work well. Lead with love. And build something that lasts.

Each lesson begins with a simple truth we’ve learned from our canine companions: faithfulness, patience, discernment, rest. And connects it to the timeless truth of Scripture. Whether you run a company or just try to show up each day with integrity, this book will remind you:

Success without love isn't real success. Strength is to protect. Rest isn’t earned; it’s given. And the One who provides is still watching over every detail.

*Tails of Grace: On Business* is not a book about getting ahead. It’s a book about walking with God, even at work.
