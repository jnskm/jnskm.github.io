## Twelve Lessons From Good Dogs About Family Pressure and Freedom

What makes you valuable?

Is it your last name? Your parents' jobs? The awards on your family's wall? Or is it something deeper, something that has nothing to do with where you come from?

Meet twelve dogs who know that pedigree doesn't determine their worth. A shelter mutt can love just as fiercely as a champion show dog. A Lab doesn't need the right friends to be happy. A German Shepherd can serve without following his family's footsteps.

Through their stories, you'll meet young people learning to navigate family expectations, cultural traditions, and the weight of being "special." You'll discover that the pressure to be perfect, to carry on traditions, or to live up to your family name doesn't have to define you.

This book is for:

* The child of immigrants carrying the weight of their parents' sacrifice
* The heir to a family business who'd rather be doing something else
* The pastor's kid who's tired of performing
* The "good child" exhausted from always holding it together
* Anyone who has wondered whether they're loved for who they are or for what they represent

The stories in this book are based on real observations of dogs and real conversations with people who've walked these paths. Family dynamics are complicated, and there are no simple answers. But we hope you'll read these stories and feel like someone understands what you've been going through.

Because here's the truth: God doesn't check your pedigree before He loves you.
