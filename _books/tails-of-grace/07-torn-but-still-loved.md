## Twelve Lessons From Good Dgos About Worth After Our Worst Moments

Have you ever felt like your worst mistake defines you? Like you're too damaged to be loved again?

*Torn, but Still Loved* offers hope for anyone carrying the weight of terrible choices. Through twelve simple stories about dogs who faced their own hard times, this book reveals profound truths about worth, forgiveness, and second chances.

Meet Kingsman, a family dog labeled "dangerous" after one scared moment. Rico, a stray learning to trust that food will keep coming. Luna, who was returned twice but finally found someone who wanted her whole story. Each dog's journey mirrors our own struggles with shame, fear, and the desperate hope that we might still be lovable despite our failures.

This isn't a book about theology. It's about real life, real mistakes, and the surprising grace that shows up when we need it most. Written in simple, accessible language, these lessons speak to:

* Anyone struggling with guilt from divorce, addiction, or broken relationships
* People who've lost jobs, destroyed trust, or hurt those they love most
* Those wondering if they're too old, too damaged, or too far gone for redemption
* Anyone who needs to hear that their worst moment doesn't define their worth
* You are torn. But you are still loved.

Whether you're dealing with the aftermath of infidelity, bankruptcy, addiction, or any other life-altering mistake, these gentle stories offer a reminder that being damaged doesn't mean being worthless. Sometimes the most broken hearts are exactly the ones God loves most tenderly.

If you've ever felt like "damaged goods," this book is for you. Your story isn't over. Your value hasn't decreased. And God is still looking for exactly who you are.
