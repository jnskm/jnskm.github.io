“India alone more than doubled its oil imports from Russia from March to April.” If this is true, it seems India is more interested in procuring energy than the survival of an entire country (Ukraine). Going forward I will not intentionally support India by buying products or services from India. Of course, Russia and China are countries I do not wish to support either.

There are certain people and certain companies that try to do good. They are not easy to find, especially when they are located in countries like India, China, or Russia. But they exist. The goal is to find them and support them. But most of the time, when something is made in China, India, or Russia, by buying that product, I am indirectly supporting a corrupt or evil regime.
