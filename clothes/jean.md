# Big John M26G (000) 26oz Selvage Denim Jeans/ Straight Fit

$380. Yes, it's a lot of money. But Big John is one of the original denim brands in Japan. 26 oz. That's thick and it's going to last a very long time. The thing that I like about Japanese-made jeans is that the Japanese are OCD about quality and I like that. I'll be brutally honest: US-made jeans, in comparison, are made poorly. The cuts are not uniform. Stitching is not straight. The attention to detail is just not there. It's like comparing Lexus to Cadillac. One is made by people who really are proud of what they do and the quality of manufacture is absolutely top notch, while the other are made by dudes that want to make money and heads out the door as soon as the bell rings. That's why I want to own a pair of the best Japanese jeans, just one, because that's all I'll need for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, they are always out of stock.
