“… although some materials can be effectively recycled and safely made from recycled content, plastics cannot. Plastic recycling does not work and will never work.” What a stupid thing to say for a chemical engineer: Jan Dell. There are plenty of examples of plastics being recycled. Of course, roughly 95% of plastics are dumped on top of mountains of trash. My goal is to minimize my purchase of plastics and to eventually get it down to zero. These are the materials that I would like in all of the products I want to or need to buy in the future: steel, glass, wood, natural textiles. No more synthetic shit. Actually, shit is good for the environment. Plastic is worse than shit.

But, who knows: we might be able to find ways not only to recycle plastic but to significantly biodegrade plastic — wherever they are — in the future.

## Advanced Technology

Should we incorporate advanced technology to make things better? But what if the advanced technology is not recyclable, not sustainable, not biodegradable, not good to the environment during the manufacturing process? Well, I don’t think it’s a very advanced technology when that technology is not good to us nor to the environment. If something is not good for the environment it is not good for us. The environment sustains us so whatever is harmful to the environment is harmful to us. When it comes to technology it has to be good for the environment. The technology has to be recyclable, sustainable, biodegradable, and in the process of manufacturing the technology it has to be good for the environment.

The use of plastic should be minimized in every device and object. The reason is plastic is very hard to recycle and is resilient to biodegradation. Plastic is terrible to the environment and therefore terrible to us. If I am choosing between two extremely capable devices the one that uses less plastic or no plastic at all is the one that I will pick.
