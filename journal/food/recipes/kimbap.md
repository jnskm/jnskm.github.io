[How To Make Gimbap](https://youtu.be/Y-Y9CXGRJPU)

* Rice
* Carrots
* Pickled Daikon
* Spinach
* Beef
* Eggs

## Rice

* Transfer to large bowl (guessing stainless steel).
* Add salt. I'll be adding Maldon seasalt.
* Add sesame oil.
* Mix.
* Let it cool.
* Cover rice when cool with lid. Don't want the rice to get dry. (Find a stainless steel bowl with a matching cover/lid.)


## Carrots

Of course, these have to be organic.

* Chop them slanted. At least that's how Maangchi does it.
* Then you slice them thinly. I think you add salt to them and then let them rest. I'll have to watch the video again. Actually, let's link the video.
* Add to large stainless steel bowl.
* Add salt.
* Mix.
* Let sweat.

## Pickled Radish / Daikon

Danmuji.

* Slice long strips.

## Spinach

* Boil water.
* Blanch 30 sec. to 1 minute.
* Rinse in bowl.
* Squeeze water out.
* Season: garlic, salt, sesame oil.

## Beef

* Use vegan hotdogs.
* Cook in hot water for 2 minutes.
* Slice long strips.

## Egg

* Use Just egg.
* Cook.
* Slice long strips.

## Sautee

* Medium heat.
* Cooking oil.
* Squeeze water out of carrots.
* 40 seconds.
* Take out.

## Seaweed Paper

* Roast over low heat.
* Shiny part down.

Made three rolls. The first one had a small portion where there were no rice. The second one had complete 360 rice covering, but there were some tears. The third one also had complete 360 rice covering, and a very small tear. The entire process took about one hour and 15 minutes. I took some to my wife and kids and they seemed to enjoy the kimbap I made.
