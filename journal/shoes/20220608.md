# Rugged

Shoes need to be rugged. I've gone walking in the nearby park several times with my casual shoes, and the poor shoes: dog shit, tree spit, and all sorts of other natural things that like to dirty up, muck up, damage my shoes.

I want my shoes to last. A long time. I don't want to have to go through the whole process buying a shoe: researchings shoes, trying on shoes, or if buying online receiving the shoes and making sure the shoes fit but if not returning them. I just don't want to go through this process every few years. I want my shoes to last at 10-20 years.
