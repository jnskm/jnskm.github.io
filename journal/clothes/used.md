[Clothes](index.md) / Used

# 20220612

Used clothing. They have already been made and used. And by buying used there is no signal going to the market saying, "Make more." But I can't buy just any used clothing. Here are my requirements:

* Brands: Known for long-lasting quality clothing such as Ralph Lauren, Filson, Eddie Bauer, Levi's.
* Textile: 100% cotton or some other natural textile.
* Made In: USA, Japan, South Korea, Italy, Germany, UK.

I also save a bit of money.

And I'll buy these off-season, meaning I'll search for winter clothes during late spring / summar, and search for spring / summer clothes, during the fall and winter.

BUT.

Like with almost everything made in the USA, consistency is a hit or miss. That's just how Americans roll. Whatever works. That's why you have Levi's 501 32x32 with actual sizes with a range. Look at some eBay listings and you'll see some with 31-inch actual wastes. 29.5 actual inseams. 33 inseams. 30 waste. Yes, I realize they shrink, but what is with sizes that are larger? What that means is that Americans are not very good at quality control, especially when people's hands are involved in making them.

If I want consistency of quality, I'll need to look at Japan and Germany.

Continuing my thoughts on used clothing and in particular the inconsistency in quality of USA-made goods. The culture makes a big difference. US culture is not centered around exactness, precision, perfection. No, it's about get it done, quickly, good enough, big. I think that's one of the reasons why manufacturing has been outsourced to countries outside of the U.S.

Even something as simple (?) as making jeans has been outsourced. I am willing to bet that the stitching in most if not all US-made jeans are inconsistent from jean to jean, from seam to seam. The lengths are inconsistent. The button placements, rivet placements are inconsistent. Colors are inconsistent. I think even the cotton is inconsistent.
